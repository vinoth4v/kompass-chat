// AI Council: N agents research the same question independently and in
// parallel, then a judge reads every answer, names the disagreements, weighs
// the evidence and synthesizes one final answer.
//
// Two properties matter more than anything else here:
//
//   1. CITATIONS ARE GROUND TRUTH. Sources are collected from the URLs an agent
//      actually searched and fetched — never from what the model claims it
//      read. A council that confidently cites invented sources is worse than no
//      council, and models invent sources readily.
//
//   2. ONE AGENT FAILING MUST NOT KILL THE COUNCIL. These are free models: the
//      measured success rate across the roster runs 79-97%, so with 3+ agents a
//      failure somewhere is the common case, not the exception. Every agent is
//      settled independently and the judge works with whatever came back.
